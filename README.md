# BizHawkDiscordRPC
I use linux now but basically clone the repo, do "pip install -r reqirements.txt".
Then open BizHawk, run the .py file, open a ROM, then go to the .py file and press enter.
If it fucks up and puts the wrong stuff in ur RPC, close the rom, close the .py file, and re-run it.
Theres nothing I can do about it unless I find a better method to get the info for the RPC.
But it's unlikely since I wont be working on this anymore.
There's also a problem with Neo-Geo ROM's and games with hyphens in their title.
But it works well enough for most use cases, including ROMs with hyphens
